    <div class="space-y-4">
      <p>Your hot new rideshare startup, Noober, has launched its MVP and is quickly becoming a viable competitor in the market. However, you've received initial feedback from users and it's clear that showing drivers random rides from all parts of the city has proven challenging for drivers, and is causing long wait times for riders. The team has decided to pivot to a UX where all available rides are shown at once.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Getting Started</h3>
      <p>Begin by heading over to <a href="https://github.com/kiei451-winter2021/noober-week4" class="text-pink-500 underline">the starter project</a> – select "Use this template", then create a repository in your own GitHub account called <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">noober-week4</span>.</p>
      <p>Open <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">index.html</span> in Chrome. You'll see that your design team has put together a prototype of what the new UI should look like, with a few hard-coded examples. Your job is to make the page read the dynamic data that's been made available by your back-end development team and display it on the page.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">The Goal</h3>
      <p>The page should read the real data, found at <a href="https://kiei451.com/api/rides.json" class="text-pink-500 underline">https://kiei451.com/api/rides.json</a>. The work to do this is already provided – simply use the <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">json</span> variable. The provided code writes out the value of this variable to the JavaScript Console in Chrome – inspect the structure of this data using the Console. Your job is to extract the data from this Object, transform it into HTML/Tailwind code that meets the design team's specifications, and append it to the <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">div</span> with the class name <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">rides</span>.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Rubric</h3>
      <p>With Noober, riders must specify the following data/criteria for their requested ride:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Phone Number</li>
        <li>Pickup Location</li>
        <li>Dropoff Location</li>
        <li>Number of passengers in their party</li>
        <li>Whether or not they would like a luxury "Noober Purple" car</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In addition, single riders (i.e. number of passengers is only 1) can request to be part of a "Noober Pool". The back-end development team has already aggregated this data; it's implied that "Noober Pool" is requested when there is more than one rider specified in the ride data. The remainder of the business logic is as follows:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
        <li>(3 points) Create a function to loop through the "legs" of a ride; take the ride object (an Array with one or more segments) as input and return the HTML that matches the design spec, based on the number of legs and the level of service.</li>
        <li>(2 points) Create a function to determine the level of service required, given a ride as input. This function should be used by both the code that displays the level of service, as well as the code that determines the border color as per requirement #4.</li>
        <li>(2 points) Create functions to generate the rider's full name, and to show the number of passengers, given a "leg" of a ride.</li>
        <li>(2 points) If the rider has requested the luxury "Purple" level of service, i.e. <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">purpleRequested</span>, display "Noober Purple" as the level of service and make the color around the ride <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">border-purple-500</span>, as shown in the design spec. Use the function you created in requirement #2 to determine the level of service.</li>
        <li>(1 point) Empty the <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">rides</span> div element; you should be left with only an empty <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">div</span> element in your HTML, but a page full of data.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Guidelines for Submission</h3>
      <p>All your work should take place in <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">noober.js</span>; i.e. that should be the only file that's modified from the original project template. Your finished product should live in your GitHub account at <span class="bg-orange-100 text-red-400 font-mono p-1">https://github.com/&lt;your GitHub username&gt;/noober-week4</span>, and <strong>this URL should be submitted as the "website URL" for this assignment in Canvas.</strong></p>
